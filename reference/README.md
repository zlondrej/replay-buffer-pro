# Replay Buffer Pro Documentation

This folder documents the Replay Buffer Pro OBS Studio plugin. The plugin adds a dockable UI panel that controls the built-in OBS replay buffer and saves selected clip durations through OBS frontend APIs.

## Architecture map
If you are new to the plugin, read in order:
1. Module entry + OBS integration: `reference/architecture/module-and-obs-integration.md`
2. UI layer (dock + widgets): `reference/architecture/ui-layer.md`
3. Replay buffer flow (save behavior): `reference/architecture/replay-buffer-flow.md`
4. Settings + hotkeys: `reference/architecture/settings-and-hotkeys.md`
5. Utilities + shared helpers: `reference/architecture/utilities.md`
6. Build + localization: `reference/architecture/build-and-localization.md`

## Runtime overview
1. OBS loads the module and registers the dock widget.
2. The dock creates UI controls (slider, spinbox, save buttons, tick labels).
3. Buffer length changes update OBS profile config and replay output settings.
4. Save actions trigger OBS replay buffer save.

## Key components and state
- `ReplayBufferPro::Plugin` is the dock widget; it owns managers, UI, and timers.
- `ReplayBufferManager` validates requests and calls the appropriate OBS replay save API.
- `SettingsManager` reads/writes OBS profile config (`RecRBTime`).
- `SaveButtonSettings` loads/saves custom save button durations globally.
- `HotkeyManager` registers per-button hotkeys and persists bindings to JSON.
